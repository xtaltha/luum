# Contributing

<sup>If you don't have the time to contribute, you can always show your support by starring this repository; sharing it with people on social media or real-life; or __simply using it__!</sup>

This file shows you three things:
1. [How to begin contributing by getting a personal copy of this repository](#getting-your-own-copy-of-this-repository-that-you-can-edit);
2. [what procedures to follow while working](#what-to-follow-while-contributing);
3. [what to do when you're done and want to merge your work with the rest](#how-to-merge-your-work-with-the-rest).

## Getting your own copy of this repository that _you_ can edit

The surefire way to get your own, personally modifiable copy, is by forking this repository and then cloning your fork.  
<sup>If the repo uses Git LFS, make sure it is installed before you clone your fork.</sup>

After you have cloned the repo, open the .cpmodproj file in [_WolvenKit_](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit), which is the standard tool for modding REDengine 4 games, like Cyberpunk 2077.

## What to follow while contributing

There are just a few things we expect you to follow while contributing.

- Always make sure to document your contributions well—open issues, or notice that you can fix one that's already open; then fix it in your fork.
- Verify your contributions are working as intended before shipping them off—most of the time when a PR is merged, manual verification is done, but in the rare cases where it is forgoed, it is most likely because it was expected that you already verified your contributions—so make sure you do.
- When using third-party content, or something that you didn't personally make, it is expected that you have full legal right to use the work in this project.
- Try to use the [_Conventional Commits_](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format for your commits.

## How to merge your work with the rest

Once you're done with your feature, verified everything according to the guidelines above, you can open a pull request and cite the issue you're closing or at least helping with in it.

Once it's done being checked and tested, you'll most likely see your work and improvements implemented into a later release. Ahh, don't you just love open source?
